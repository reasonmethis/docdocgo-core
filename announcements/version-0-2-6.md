### GPT-4o mini and other updates

First, DocDocGo had a teeny-tiny issue with its database growing too gigantic for its VM. The issue is now fixed, so if you tried to use DocDocGo and couldn't access it, my apologies - it's now back in action! :muscle::

Updates:

**For users:** 

1. The default model is now **GPT-4o mini** (thanks, OpenAI! :rocket:) instead of GPT-3.5, so expect a significant improvement in the quality of responses. If you use DocDocGo with you own OpenAI API key, you can also switch to GPT-4o, GPT-4, or the old friend GPT-3.5.
2. The database has been upgraded and cleaned up for better performance.

**For developers:** 

1. The [developer docs](https://github.com/reasonmethis/docdocgo-core/blob/main/README-FOR-DEVELOPERS.md) have been significantly expanded to include lots of goodies on hosting the Chroma database server on AWS and GCP, running locally with Docker, cleaning it, etc. There is a lot more that can (and should) be added, so if something is unclear or you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to DM me here or on [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitriyvasilyuk/).
2. In addition to cleaning up the database, Langchain and Chroma DB have been upgraded to the latest versions (0.2.10 and 0.5.4, respectively). A slew of deprecated imports have been updated, and a bug related to a breaking change in Langchain's `Chroma` has been found and squashed :beetle:.

I hope you enjoy using DocDocGo with the shiny new GPT-4o mini! Because of the model switch and other major changes, it's possible that there may be some hiccups that I haven't caught yet. Feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/reasonmethis/docdocgo-core) if you see any :spider:, and the exterminator will be dispatched posthaste!
